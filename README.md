# Natural Language Processing
Some models I have implemented from scratch in PyTorch using various tutorials and papers. 

## List of models
+ [x] Seq2Seq
+ [ ] Seq2Seq with attention (work in progress)
+ [ ] Transformer architecture (based on the `Attention is all you need' paper [1])
+ [ ] GPT-like model from scratch
